\section{Evaluation}
The following evaluations are done according to the provided Gold Standard. In order to evaluate we considered percentage of precision versus recall for each case, then we calculated interpolated precision for four recall level of  25\% 50\%, 75\% and 100\%, and at the end we calculated average value of each level.

As you can see, in our algorithm we only considered sub chapters, that had their own html-file, as separate entities.Therefore, many of the sub chapters in the gold standard did not show up as separate hits in our ranking that has caused we do not have good document retrieval and as our evaluation is based on gold standard our precision was not so accurate especially for cases like 6, 7, and 8 that relevant documents are in sub chapters that it is obvious in both the table and graph of precision versus recall.

cases of 6 and 8  searches had a gold standard chapter as the top hit. Exceptions was case 5, which has no relevant chapters, and case 7 with gold chapters on 2. and 4. place. All gold standard chapters can be found via the top  4 hits of our respective case search results.
